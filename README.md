# ML4NLP-2022


This is the code for the project in period three of Machine Learning for NLP (RM) (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam). 
There is code from the book for OCR experiment and adaptation for sentiment analysis. 

To do OCR, run all the cells in nn_book_dorien.ipynb. Change the directory, under Using my handwriting, to use different images to test the network's ability to recognize digits.   

To do sentiment analysis with embeddings, run embeddings.ipynb. Additionally, the embedding model should be placed in the same directory as the code.      
To do sentiment analysis with TF-IDF features, run tfidf.ipynb.
